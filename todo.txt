=======================================
UI
ON SIGNUP
1, queue the email sending process so it doesn't take time__sec()
ON SIGNUP EMAIL CONFIRMATION
1. CREATE A PAGE THAT tells the user congrats on activation/verification of email
1b. an email should be sent to the user in respect to 1a. the email should say, now,
